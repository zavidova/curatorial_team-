				Mateo Broillet explores how type specimens can be used in a critical approach to type publishing. Through his work, he subverts the structure of type specimens in order to reveal the role of typography as a means to serve a political end.
				Generally used as a placeholder text, the Latin phrase Lorem Ipsum exemplifies how information is filtered through automated headline generators, turning it into clickbait. Through one of his type specimens, Preciado he appropriates automation in a variable font especially suited for titling layouts in yellow journalism. Aware of the continuous negotiation between design history and cultural expression, Mateo’s work is a light hearted graphic design answer to the rhetoric of journalistic information.

				Set in a pixelated flat environment, <i>This is Where We Jump</i> is a video game played from the viewpoint of an ideal, which is represented by the character Jump. The subject of the game is perspective, or better, the lack of it. To play <i>TIWWJ</i> is to navigate a world while feeling lost.
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>This is Where We Jump</i> is an entangled collection of short stories, navigated by the player. Depending on the path the player takes, different stories about how They live are discovered. In anticipating that which is to come, <i>Jump</i> finds confinement in mundane details and humourful situations. <i>This is Where We Jump</i> is a game about falling in love with the unknown.

			<p>
				<i>Ecology of Wounds</i> is a film that shows how our asymmetrical relationship with nature causes geological harm. Drawing an analogy between nature and the human body, Asja Keeman juxtaposes a forest that has borne human destruction with an intimate account of pain caused by self-harm.
				Using the wound as a metaphor, she recounts how enduring pain inflicted through self-harm is a means of gaining control. With this work, Asja implies that similar mechanisms underlie the destructive relationship we have with nature.

			<p>
				Today, any inhabitant of a city is treated as a computational User by default. Smooth interfaces and real-time feedback loops augment our urban experiences, making us feel empowered, while subjecting us to processes of profiling, quantification, optimisation and isolation. However, the sense of comfort and personal freedom that is gained comes at the cost of political agency and autonomy.
			</p>
			<p>
				Drawing on a series of interviews with practitioners, ranging from policy researchers to UX designers, Anastasia Kubrak gives insight into what it means to be a human User in today’s technological infrastructures. What strategies can we employ to gain more agency? How can we become aware of our own position and be re-politicised?

			<p>
				<i>Chasing Lizards...and Other Memories</i> is a reconciliation of fragmented memory through the use of personal short stories and prose. The work illustrates how memory sticks to places we go, how it adheres to our clothes, how it mares our speech, and how it comes to define our livelihoods later in life.
			</p>
			<p>
				Through the realisation that black women, existing at the intersection of race and sex, tend to shrink back and be silenced, these stories aim to take up space and lay waste to the reoccurring theme of being bent into shape.

				<i>GlyphDrawing.club</i> is a contemporary texmode graphics editor with endless possibilities for making custom modular type design, illustrations, pattern design, concrete poetry, ASCII art and much more. The editor is inspired by old-school ASCII art editors, keeping some of the limitations of textmode art but bringing it to modern times; with the editor you can use any font and any glyph to create your compositions. The editor also comes with a custom "Truchet tile / FontStruct" style typeface for making modular design, and a variety of other fonts for making more traditional ASCII art.

			<p>
				Immersed in a stream of images, texts, and videos, Stefanie Luchtenberg explores how life is mediated through digital interfaces. Designed to go unnoticed, Stefanie draws attention to the sense of comfort that the constant presence of the scroll bar, the search box, and the blinking cursor bring.
				What these interfaces frame is our social interactions. Beyond the screen, they infuse our thoughts, our behaviour, and our expectations. Observing the ways in which we live in and through these devices, Stefanie shows how new forms of intimacy emerge through our daily experiences with our devices.

		</div>
		<div class="main-content">
			<img src="images/final_projects/juan_1.jpg">
			<p>
				<i>Salpicón</i> is a browser film that explores “conflict aesthetics”. Using a mix of real and fictional footage, Juan Pablo Mejia reflects on post-conflict politics in Colombia through the narrative form of telenovelas.
			</p>
			<p>
				The fruit drink “salpicón” serves as a metaphor for understanding the tropical mixture of quotidian and extravagant Colombian micro-politics. Evoking its melodrama, and employing literary devices such as spinoffs and cliffhangers, Juan Pablo reflects upon the ways in which the aftermath of peace processes in post-conflict Colombia is analogous to a perfectly polished telenovela-esque cliffhanger—unstable and undefinable. 			</p>

				<i>UNIONIZE</i> is an uprising of the creative worker. The installation consists of a performer who inhabits a shelving unit, within which she produces shiny and colourful surfaces.
			</p>
			<p>
				Tereza Rullerova’s performance is a response to the current labour conditions in the creative industry. Exhausted from constant labour caused by the merging of work and life, the creative worker performs in a never-ending shift.
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>UNIONIZE</i> invites visitors to join a temporary union, and to establish common interests through performative design. Whereas unions traditionally represent workers operating within defined work hours, Tereza explores what a union for creative industry could be, aiming to connect and emancipate all “users-playbourers”.
